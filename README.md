# 7app - Social Media Platform

**7app** is an academic project based on a relational database with NoSQL extensions, designed to simulate a full-featured social media platform. It focuses on data management, user interaction analysis, and the development of recommendation algorithms.

## 🔍 Project Description

This system allows users to:

- Manage personal profiles with detailed information and content history.
- Publish posts and interact through comments and reactions.
- Follow other users and participate in interest-based groups.
- Send and receive private messages (one-on-one and group).
- Receive content and connection suggestions through recommendation algorithms.
- Analyze user engagement and behavior trends with advanced queries.

The backend is powered by a **MySQL** relational database and integrates **MongoDB** to handle semi-structured content such as textual posts, private messages, and image metadata.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **MySQL** – for structured relational data management.
- **MongoDB** – for flexible handling of semi-structured user-generated content.
